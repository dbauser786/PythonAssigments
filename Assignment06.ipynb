    "Q1. Define Object Orient Programming Language ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented language (OOL) is a high-level computer programming language that implements objects and their associated procedures within the programming context to create software programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented language uses an object-oriented programming technique that binds related data and functions into an object and encourages reuse of these objects within the same and other programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The object-oriented programming language approach encourages:\n",
    "\n",
    "A. Modularisation: \n",
    "   where the application can be decomposed into modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "B. Software re-use: \n",
    "   where an application can be composed from existing and new modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object-oriented programming language generally supports five main following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "i.   Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "ii.  Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "iv.  Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "v.   Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. List down the Benefits of OOP ?\n",
    "\n",
    "The benifits of OOP are mentioned below:\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP provides a clear modular structure for programs.\n",
    "It is good for defining abstract data types.\n",
    "Implementation details are hidden from other modules and other modules has a clearly defined interface.\n",
    "It is easy to maintain and modify existing code as new objects can be created with small differences to existing ones.\n",
    "objects, methods, instance, message passing, inheritance are some important properties provided by these particular languages.\n",
    "encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction are also counts in these fundamentals of programming language.\n",
    "It implements real life scenario.\n",
    "In OOP, programmer not only defines data types but also deals with operations applied for data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major benefit of object-oriented programming is the object mechanism itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The object mechanism is a significant software invention that is useful for all programming languages and paradigms because it fixes the three major problems with high-level languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#1 Objects allow programmers to define any type of variable that can be used as if the variable were native to the language. And a limited number of types of variables has always been a problem with high-level languages. I once needed a quaternion variable which was difficult to program because I didn’t have the object mechanism. And the original BASIC language was developed just to provide a matrix variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2 Objects allow programmers to organize all software as objects instead of the dozens of confusing module organizing and linking mechanisms that currently exist. In short, the object is a superior software organizing mechanism; it is the basis of Microsoft’s .NET software system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#3 Objects allow programmers to use all technologies and system services as a family of consistent objects instead of the dozens of confusing APIs that are currently in use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second landmark invention in OOP is inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a new revolutionary (optional) architectural mechanism that allows programmers to use old software in a manner never before seen in computer programming. Inheritance can be used to quickly create needed software from a library of standard objects such as Web pages, graphics, data base processing, user interfaces, and other complex technologies. For example, I can create an entire, fully functional Web page for my program by merely inheriting a standard Web page object from my library. I can create and use a fully functional database by merely inheriting a standard database object from my library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that it is not necessary to use inheritance to use the object mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "The object mechanism is extremely useful by itself and many competent software engineers and programming languages never use inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplicity: \n",
    "software objects model real world objects, so the complexity is reduced and the program structure is very clear; \n",
    "Modularity: \n",
    "each object forms a separate entity whose internal workings are decoupled from other parts of the system; \n",
    "Modifiability: \n",
    "it is easy to make minor changes in the data representation or the procedures in an OO program. Changes inside a class do not affect any other part of a program, since the only public interface that the external world has \n",
    "to a class is through the use of methods; \n",
    "Extensibility: \n",
    "adding new features or responding to changing operating environments can be solved by introducing a few new objects and modifying some existing ones; \n",
    "Maintainability: \n",
    "objects can be maintained separately, making locating and fixing problems easier; \n",
    "Re-usability: \n",
    "objects can be reused in different programs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Differentiate between function and method? ?\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a piece of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. the parameters) and can optionally return data (the return value). All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object. In most respects it is identical to a function except for two key differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "A method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called.\n",
    "A method is able to operate on data that is contained within the class (remembering that an object is an instance of a class - the class is the definition, the object is an instance of that data).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Define the following terms?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Class\n",
    "A  class is a collection of objects with similar attributes and operations.\n",
    "Eg. Class – Account It will create an object savings_account belonging to the class Account.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Object\n",
    "Objects are the basic run time entities in an object oriented system. They may represent a person, a place or any item that a program hasto handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Attribute\n",
    "Data in a class are called attributes.\n",
    "Attributes are the individual things that differentiate one object from another and determine the appearance, state, or other qualities of that object.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Behavior\n",
    "behaviors are called methods\n",
    "behavior determines how an instance of that class operates; for example, how it will \"react\" if asked to do something by another class or object or if its internal state changes. Behavior is the only way objects can do anything to themselves or have anything done to them.\n"
